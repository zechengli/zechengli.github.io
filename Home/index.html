      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>When it comes to sports, the reason I love it is because it‚Äôs the best way to truly interact with others, the world, and yourself.</p>

      <h3>Running</h3>
      <p>
        I‚Äôve always enjoyed running growing up and participated in many running competitions. My best 100-meter time was 12.3 seconds when I was 18. I didn‚Äôt formally measure my 200m or 400m times.
        I started marathon running when I was diagnosed with fatty liver and wanted to lose weight. I was also inspired by the anime <em>Run with the Wind</em>. I completed my first marathon in 2024 without preparation. You can view my records here:

      </ul>
      <p>Running gives me both mental and physical strength. It‚Äôs a space to reflect on life, push limits, and work toward a better version of myself.</p>

      <h3>Pole Vaulting</h3>
      <p>
        I was also a collegiate athlete when I was 18 at AHNU. In Chinese college sports, there are groups A (general students), B (professional athletes), and C (elite athletes). I was in Group A and represented AHNU at the provincial games.
        I placed 8th in pole vaulting with a jump of 2.9 meters. Interestingly, I was originally training for 800m and 1500m events, but the coach realized I wouldn‚Äôt score points there. They switched me to pole vaulting ‚Äî after just 3 months of training, I managed to score.
        I was almost cut from the team before that.

      <h3>MMA</h3>
      <p>
        I practiced taekwondo growing up, and in the U.S. I picked up MMA because I wanted to become stronger and tougher. But as I‚Äôve gotten older, I now prioritize protecting myself ‚Äî so I stopped and focus on running instead.
        Here‚Äôs a sparring video from 2021 with a professional MMA fighter:

      <h3>League of Legends</h3>
      <p>
        I was very lucky to join UNL's varsity League of Legends team in 2024. We competed in the CCL and won the Fall 2024 Championship.
        Yes, I‚Äôm addicted to video games, and I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reflecting on that.

      </p>
      <p>
        My peak rank was Master 450LP, but I‚Äôve retired because the game no longer aligns with my future goals. That said, I‚Äôve learned a tremendous amount from it ‚Äî it made me a better team player, especially in Western team environments.
        Even though esports may not be physically demanding, the mental pressure can exceed that of many traditional sports. The program was scholarship-supported, but I already had a research assistantship at the time, so I didn‚Äôt receive funding.

      <p>Here‚Äôs the video of our victory:</p>
