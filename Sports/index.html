      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>When it comes to sports, the reason I loved it because it is the best way to truly interact with others, world and yourself.</p>

      <p>First, I would talk about me liking running:</p>
      <p>I always like to run growning up, I attend all the running competition growing up, my best 100 meters time is 12.3 seconds, when I was 18 years old. I did not measure 200 and 400.<br>
      And I started to run marathon because at one time I had fat liver and I want to lose some weight, and I was also introduced into running by this anime called "run with the wind".<br>
      Then I did my first marathon in 2024 without paraperation, then you can view my record here: <a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=16852&rid=1068">2024 Marathon</a><br>
      and I was able to run another one in 2025: <a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=18668&rid=933">2025 Marathon</a><br>
      You can found me on Strava: <a href="https://strava.app.link/yktpd1EGUTb">Strava Profile</a></p>

      <p>I think running gives me mental and physical health, it also gives me a lot of time to think about life. And to be able to become a better version of myself, is also a reason me addicting to it.</p>

      <p>Second: pole vaulting:<br>
      I was also a colligatie athlete was I was 18 years old at AHNU, back then there were Group ABC, A is for all the normal people, B is for professional athlete, C is for high level athlete. I am in the Group A, and I representing AHNU in the province game,<br>
      I won the 8th place in pole vaulting, I jumped 2.9 meters.<br>
      Interesting fact was that, I was going for 800, 1500 meters, and coach told me I won't win any score for the team, so they put me in pole vaulting for just 3 months, I was able to score. I was almost out of the team because I was not good enough.<br>

      <p>Third, MMA.<br>
      I growing up practing tak won do, and then when I was in the US, I want to be a strong man and a tough man, I learned MMA. But with me growing older, I want to protect myself, so I stopped doing it, now I only running.<br>
      Here is a old video of me sparring with a professional mma fighter in 2021:<br>
      <video src="boxing.mp4" controls style="max-width:100%; margin: 1em 0;"></video></p>

      <p>The last but not least, League of legend:<br>
      I was very lucky to join our school's varsity team in 2024, represent UNL to conpet in the CCL. And we won a champion in the 2024 Fall Season. This is the video:</p>
