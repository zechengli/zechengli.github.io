      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>When it comes to sports, the reason I love them is because they're the best way to truly interact with others, the world, and myself.</p>

      <h3>Running</h3>
      <p>
        I've always enjoyed running growing up and participated in many competitions. My best 100-meter time was 12.3 seconds when I was 18. I didn't formally record my 200m or 400m times.
        I started marathon running after being diagnosed with fatty liver and wanting to lose weight. I was also inspired by the anime <em>Run with the Wind</em>. I completed my first marathon in 2024 without any preparation. You can view my records here:<br>

        <a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=18668&rid=933" target="_blank">2025 Marathon</a><br>
        Find me on Strava: <a href="https://strava.app.link/yktpd1EGUTb" target="_blank">https://strava.app.link/yktpd1EGUTb</a>
      </p>
      <p>Running gives me both mental and physical strength. It gives me time to reflect on life, push my limits, and work toward becoming a better version of myself.</p>

      <h3>Pole Vaulting</h3>
      <p>
        I was also a collegiate athlete at AHNU when I was 18. In Chinese college sports, there are three groups: A (general students), B (professional athletes), and C (elite athletes). I was in Group A and represented AHNU at the provincial games.
        I placed 8th in pole vaulting with a jump of 2.9 meters. Interestingly, I originally trained for the 800m and 1500m events, but the coach realized I wouldn't score points there. So they switched me to pole vaulting — and after just 3 months of training, I managed to score.
        I was almost cut from the team before that.

      <h3>MMA</h3>
      <p>
        I practiced taekwondo growing up. After coming to the U.S., I picked up MMA because I wanted to become stronger and tougher. But as I've grown older, I've started prioritizing my health and safety, so I stopped MMA and now focus solely on running.
        Here's a sparring video from 2021 with a professional MMA fighter:

      <h3>League of Legends</h3>
      <p>
        I was very lucky to join UNL's varsity League of Legends team in 2024. We competed in the CCL and won the Fall 2024 Championship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I'm addicted to video games, and I've spent a lot of time reflecting on that. Here's my profile: <a href="https://op.gg/lol/summoners/na/Lampre-NA96" target="_blank">Lampre-NA96 on OP.GG</a>.
        My peak rank was Master 450 LP, but I've since retired because I realized this game wouldn't contribute to my future path.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I learned a tremendous amount from League. It taught me how to be an effective team player in a Western team environment, and I truly cherish the time spent with my teammates.
        Although esports may not be as physically demanding as traditional sports, the mental intensity is just as high—if not higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program was scholarship-sponsored, but since I already had an assistantship, I didn't receive any financial benefit.
        Here's the video of our victory:
