  <h2>Sports</h2>
  <p>When it comes to sports, the reason I love it is because it’s the best way to truly interact with others, the world, and yourself.</p>

  <h3>Running</h3>
  <p>
    I’ve always enjoyed running growing up and participated in many running competitions. My best 100-meter time was 12.3 seconds when I was 18. I didn’t formally measure my 200m or 400m times.
    I started marathon running when I was diagnosed with fatty liver and wanted to lose weight. I was also inspired by the anime <em>Run with the Wind</em>. I completed my first marathon in 2024 without preparation. You can view my records here:<br>

  <p>Running gives me both mental and physical strength. It’s a space to reflect on life, push limits, and work toward a better version of myself.</p>

  <h3>Pole Vaulting</h3>
  <p>
    I was also a collegiate athlete when I was 18 at AHNU. In Chinese college sports there are groups A (general students), B (professional athletes), and C (elite athletes). I was in Group A and represented AHNU at the provincial games.
    I placed 8th in pole vaulting with a jump of 2.9 meters. Interestingly, I was originally training for 800m and 1500m events, but the coach realized I wouldn’t score points there. They switched me to pole vaulting — after just 3 months of training, I managed to score.
    I was almost cut from the team before that.

  <h3>MMA</h3>
  <p>
    I practiced taekwondo growing up, and in the U.S. I picked up MMA because I wanted to become stronger and tougher. But as I’ve gotten older, I now prioritize protecting myself — so I stopped and focus on running instead.
    Here’s a sparring video from 2021 with a professional MMA fighter:

  <h3>League of Legends</h3>
  <p>
    I was very lucky to join UNL's varsity League of Legends team in 2024. We competed in the CCL and won the Fall 2024 Championship.
    Here’s the video of our victory:
