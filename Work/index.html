      <h2>Work Experience</h2>

      <p><strong>Feb 2024 – Present</strong> — <em>Research Engineer, University of Nebraska–Lincoln</em><br>
      I work with Dr. Shubhendu Bhardwaj on antenna design and RF engineering. Our collaboration has resulted in a publication in this area.

      <p><strong>Feb 2023 – Feb 2024</strong> — <em>Graduate Research Assistant, University of Nebraska–Lincoln</em><br>
      I worked with Dr. Shuai Nie on research related to wireless communication propagation channels, depth camera technologies, and ray tracing simulations.<br><br>

      Here are some sample images related to my work (created before the ChatGPT era):<br>

      <p><strong>Aug 2018 – Oct 2022</strong> — <em>Software Engineer, Hancock Software</em><br>
      I joined Hancock Software full-time after interning there during my undergraduate studies. As an international student, I was fortunate to secure the internship through a family connection—my aunt is the company’s founder.</p>

      <p>
        During my four years there, I contributed across multiple areas of development and led impactful initiatives. One major project was a complete data migration from an old application to a new one, which I implemented and deployed to production single-handedly after thorough testing and staging. The software served over 100 users and managed data for more than 100,000 individuals. I maintained high code quality and reliability throughout, with no critical issues requiring senior developer intervention.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I gained valuable experience, working for a family member came with unique challenges—recognition is hard-earned and criticism hits harder. After four years, I made the difficult decision to leave the role while on an H1B visa to pursue new opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tech stack:</strong> C#, AngularJS, MSSQL. I also utilized Jenkins for automated deployments. The product itself supported nonprofit organizations, such as community action agencies, in assessing and managing benefits for low-income families.<br>

        Because of credential limitations, I am not allowed to share additional details about the product, but I’m happy to discuss it further if you’re interested.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Other Experience</strong><br>
      I also worked as a swimming lifeguard, delivery driver, phone plan salesman, and tutor between the ages of 17 and 22.</p>
