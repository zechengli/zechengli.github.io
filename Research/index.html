      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve had three meaningful research experiences so far, and I deeply appreciate all the professors who guided me along the way.
      </p>

      <h3>Undergraduate Research with Dr. Sheng Wei (2017–2018)</h3>
      <p>
        During my undergraduate studies, I worked with <a href="https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~sw891/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Sheng Wei</a>, focusing on digital signatures — signing files with a private key and verifying with a public key. Our research explored vulnerabilities in Ring doorbells, especially in video signature verification. Though we didn’t publish, it was a foundational experience for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also participated in the <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/2018-DAC-SDC/" target="_blank">DAC 2018 System Design Contest</a>, training my first machine learning model for image recognition. It didn’t win, but it sparked my interest in ML.
      </p>

      <h3>Master's Research with Dr. Shuai Nie (2023–2024)</h3>
      <p>
        I joined <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~snie/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Shuai Nie’s</a> lab to secure funding as a master’s student, and it turned into an eye-opening experience. I built a two-ray wireless propagation model for optimizing Wi-Fi placement using depth cameras. It was my first deep dive into wireless communication and ray tracing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we didn’t publish, I developed strong technical skills and a clearer sense of academic research expectations.
      </p>

      <h3>Research with Dr. Shubhendu Bhardwaj (2024–Now)</h3>
      <p>
        Under <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/person/shubhendu-bhardwaj/" target="_blank">Dr. Shubhendu Bhardwaj</a>, I worked on a wireless temperature sensing system using bimetallic strips and impedance reflection. Changes in temperature affect the S11 parameter, which we monitor for fault prediction in turbines and trains. I handled antenna design, RF measurements, and led our paper submission to IEEE-APS 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Bhardwaj has been an incredible mentor — supportive, patient, and deeply knowledgeable. This was the first time I truly felt like a contributing researcher.
      </p>

      <h3>Looking Ahead — Ph.D. Aspirations</h3>
      <p>
        If I pursue a Ph.D., I’d love to work on wearable devices or human-performance-centered engineering. My interests lie at the intersection of health and wireless systems — improving people’s lives through smart tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also drawn to passionate mentors who truly care about innovation beyond papers and funding. While I may not be the strongest on paper, I bring grit, curiosity, and persistence to every opportunity.
