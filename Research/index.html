      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>I’ve had three meaningful research experiences so far, and I deeply appreciate all the professors who have guided me along the way.</p>

      <h3>Undergraduate Research with Dr. Sheng Wei (2016–2017)</h3>
      <p>
        During my undergraduate studies, I worked with 
        <a href="https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~sw891/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Sheng Wei</a> 
        on digital signatures and potential vulnerabilities in Ring doorbells. Although we didn’t publish a paper, I gained valuable insights into hardware and multimedia security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I participated in the 
        <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/2018-DAC-SDC/" target="_blank">DAC 2018 System Design Contest</a>, 
        where I trained a machine learning model for image recognition — my first exposure to ML research.

      </p>

      <h3>Master’s Research with Dr. Shuai Nie (2023–2024)</h3>
      <p>
        With 
        <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~snie/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Shuai Nie</a>, 
        I modeled a wireless two-ray propagation system to optimize Wi-Fi access point placement in complex environments using a depth camera. This hands-on research deepened my understanding of RF propagation.

      </p>

      <h3>Research with Dr. Shubhendu Bhardwaj (2024–Present)</h3>
      <p>
        Working with 
        <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/person/shubhendu-bhardwaj/" target="_blank">Dr. Bhardwaj</a>, 
        I co-authored a paper (to appear at IEEE-APS 2025) on a wireless temperature sensing system using impedance shifts caused by a bimetallic strip. I led the design and measurement aspects.
      </p>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        I’m interested in pursuing a Ph.D. at the intersection of wireless communication and human health. I want to build wearable devices or systems that enhance well-being and performance — combining engineering with purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe research shouldn’t just be about publishing papers — it should be about building things that truly benefit the world. I admire professors who genuinely enjoy talking about their research, even when it involves hardship and setbacks. That passion shows me that research is a stage for warriors — those who endure and shine through challenges.
