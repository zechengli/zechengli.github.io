          <strong>2013–2015:</strong> Anhui Normal University – Software Engineering (GPA: 2.9)
          <p class="edu-note">
            Yes, I took the GaoKao (College Entrance Exam) and was ranked about 50,000 out of 280,000 students in my province.
            I am not smart and I did not work hard enough either. I went to the No.1 High School in Tongling City, I ranked about 400th out of 900 people on average.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2015–2018:</strong> University of Nebraska–Lincoln – BSc Computer Science (GPA: 3.42)
          <p class="edu-note">
            I transferred from AHNU to UNL in 2015. Why UNL? Because the tuition was affordable and UNL offered me the earliest. 
            I was also accepted to other schools like the University of New Hampshire and the ASU. Wait-listed at U of Minnesota.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2022–2024:</strong> University of Nebraska–Lincoln – MSc Computer Science (GPA: 3.89)
          <p class="edu-note">
            I couldn’t find a job at the time and was also accepted to Boston University. I chose UNL again because of the scholarship, and I love the city of Lincoln.

      <h3>My Perspective on Education</h3>
      <p>
        I think nowadays, all knowledge can be learned by ChatGPT — anyone can build something great with the help of AI. The key is being <strong>adaptive</strong>.
        <br><br>
        Going to class is mostly meaningless. I'd say I learned 90% of what I know by myself(search the answer and practice it, remember it first then intuitively get used to it). 
        Attending class is more about connecting with classmates and professors.
        <br><br>
        However, standardized tests like GaoKao, SAT, or TOEFL — and LeetCode-style interviews — are still extremely important. 
        They reflect your intelligence and work ethic. They're the most efficient way to filter talent.
        I got 494 in Gaokao, 82 points in TOFEL(2014), 320 points in GRE (153 and 167).
        I roughly did 200 questions on Leetcode, I want to honestly say that I don't have the talent doing Leetcode, maybe I am not working hard enough? I don't know. Failed Microsoft SDE Interview 2 times.
