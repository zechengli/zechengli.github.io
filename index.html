        <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  I am currently a Research Engineer at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, specializing in electromagnetic waves, antenna design, and RF engineering. I also have four years of software development experience, along with a strong background in data structures and algorithms (DSA) and a solid foundation in machine learning (ML).

<div id="research" class="section" style="display: none;">
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve had three meaningful research experiences so far, and I deeply appreciate all the professors who guided me along the way.
  </p>

  <h3>Part 1: Undergraduate Research with Dr. Sheng Wei (2017-2018)</h3>
  <p>
    During my undergraduate studies, I worked with <a href="https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~sw891/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Sheng Wei</a>, a hardworking and down-to-earth professor who treated his students with great respect.
    Our research focused on digital signatures — the process of signing a file using a private key and allowing the recipient to verify it with a public key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Wei specialized in hardware and multimedia security. At the time, we were exploring possible vulnerabilities in Ring doorbells, particularly during the video segment signing and verification process. Though we didn’t publish a paper, this was a valuable learning experience for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later, I attended the <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/2018-DAC-SDC/" target="_blank">DAC 2018 System Design Contest</a>, which was one of my first exposures to training machine learning models. I successfully trained a model to recognize images, although I didn’t win an award. Overall, this was a fantastic experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Part 2: Master's Research with Dr. Shuai Nie (2023-2024)</h3>
  <p>
    I joined <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~snie/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Shuai Nie’s</a> group primarily seeking funding as a master’s student, but it turned into an eye-opening experience in wireless communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    I built a two-ray wireless propagation model. The concept was that in a corner environment, a transmitter's signal could reflect off two walls and return to the original point. By inputting the transmitter’s position and wall coordinates, I could calculate the shortest reflective path. This was aimed at optimizing access point placement using a depth camera, especially in high-traffic areas like airports, to ensure strong Wi-Fi performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Nie is one of the smartest people I’ve worked with, and her academic rigor was inspiring. Although I didn’t publish a paper during this time, I gained substantial technical insight and confidence in my research abilities.
  </p>

  <h3>Part 3: Research with Dr. Shubhendu Bhardwaj (Master's & OPT) (2024 - Now)</h3>
  <p>
    I started working with <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/person/shubhendu-bhardwaj/" target="_blank">Dr. Shubhendu Bhardwaj</a> during my master’s and OPT period. At first, I had little understanding of the work, but I kept showing up — and eventually, I got accepted as the first author on my first-ever paper, which will appear at IEEE-APS 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our research involves developing a wireless system to detect temperature changes inside rollers in wind turbines or trains, which often overheat. We use a bimetallic strip that changes shape with temperature. This causes a shift in the internal impedance, which affects the S11 parameter. By monitoring changes in S11, we can infer the internal temperature. I was responsible for the design and measurement, and I’m incredibly proud of this achievement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Bhardwaj has been extremely patient and supportive, serving as both an excellent professor and a kind mentor. Working with him gave me the confidence to know that I can make real contributions to research.
  </p>
<h3>Part 4: Looking Ahead — Thoughts on a Ph.D.</h3>
<p>
  I’ve been thinking about this for a long time — if I were to pursue a Ph.D., what direction would I choose?
</p>
<p>
  I'm a sports fanatic, and I’ve always been fascinated by the human body. I’d love to work on wearable devices or anything at the intersection of health and wireless communication. Applying engineering to improve human performance or well-being is something that truly excites me.
</p>
<p>
  That said, I’m also open to exploring other directions — especially if my future advisor is genuinely passionate about their research. I believe I can tell when someone is doing research just to publish or secure funding, versus when they truly want to create meaningful innovation. I want to work with people who care deeply about what they do.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve faced a lot of adversity in my life, and if there’s one thing I have more than most students, it’s grit — the courage to start again and again. I may not be the strongest candidate on paper, but I bring resilience, perseverance, and an open mind to every opportunity. I’m ready to keep learning and to keep moving forward, no matter how many times I have to start from scratch.
